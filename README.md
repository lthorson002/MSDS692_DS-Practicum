**ABSTRACT**

Characterized datasets for “Heartbeat Sounds” are available on Kaggle. The sets
consist of recorded audio files that were collected via an iPhone app and
approximately 70% were labeled as “normal”, “murmur”, “extra heart sounds”, and
“artifact”. The focus of this study was to focus on the “normal” and “murmur”
file sets to create a machine learning classification model that would allow for
a quick assessment of a patient’s heart sounds, while in the doctor’s office.
Performing the code work in R, several functions were authored to loop through
the directory containing the recordings, efficiently reading the “.wav” files,
preprocessing the resulting signal, and ultimately extracting the acoustic
signals and indices. Finally, training and test sets were built and evaluated
using three machine learning techniques: K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support
Machine Vector (SVM), and Random Forest. Evaluation of the models resulted in
the best classification results with SVM and caret optimization .
